FREEMON (HANGMAN) PROJECT

<BRIEF>
For project #1, I created a simple game of ‘hangman’
The player is able to choose [{userName, difficultyLevel, character}] to play the game. Given all data set up, user is navigated to a game page and is able to play game. The player is given a mystery word and is able to select letter buttons to guess the word. Player is given 10 guesses. Once the player guess right letters and the correct word, the displayed score increases, and if player guess an incorrect letter, displayed number of guesses decreases. At the end of each game round, the player can either try next word(win) and play again(lose: next player gets to play).

<THEME>
I wanted my game to look friendly and attractive to the users. So my game theme is Pokemon. The player’s goal is to guess the word right and to free Pokemon that is chosen from the beginning. Once the player guesses an incorrect letter, Pokemon is being confined.
